Townhouse binary clock

Inspired by [this Kickstarter project.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1050329560/the-city-clock-paris-design)

Each column of window represent the binary value of the hour/minute respectively:  
 - First column is tenth digit of the hour  
 - Second column is single digit of the hour  
 - Third column is tenth digit of the minute  
 - Forth column is single digit of the minute  

Each row of windows represents value of 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 and 2^3 with lights on indicating bit is on.

This is just a personal project for fun, it is designed to not rely on any external graphics, so the design is bare bone at the moment but future version may improve upon the artistic vision.

For aesthetic purposes the app is designed without titlebars, so only a few window operations are supported at the moment:  
1.) Click and hold anywhere within the app (except the door and moon) to move the clock.  
2.) Click on the moon to minimize the clock.  
3.) Click on the door to exit (with confirmation).  

Suggestions/comments are welcome!
